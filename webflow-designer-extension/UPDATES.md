# Webflow Designer Extension - Updates

## Changes Made (Latest)

### 🎯 **Fixed Issues:**

1. **Toggle Buttons Now Appear in Navigator Panel**
   - Buttons now appear next to element names in the left sidebar (Navigator/Layers panel)
   - No longer trying to add buttons to canvas elements
   - Buttons are compact (18x18px) and integrate seamlessly

2. **10-Second Search Limit**
   - Extension only searches for elements during the first 10 seconds after page load
   - Prevents performance issues from continuous scanning
   - Stops infinite loops and excessive console logging

3. **Smarter Element Matching**
   - Finds canvas elements by `data-wf-id` attribute
   - Matches them to corresponding Navigator panel items
   - Uses a Set to track processed elements (no duplicates)

4. **Auto-Close Publish Modal**
   - After publishing, the modal automatically closes
   - Uses multiple methods: close button, ESC key, backdrop click

### 🔧 **How It Works:**

1. **Initialization (First 2 seconds)**
   - Loads settings from chrome.storage
   - Waits for Navigator panel to be ready
   - Waits for canvas iframe to load

2. **Element Discovery (2-10 seconds)**
   - Scans canvas iframe for elements with `data-show-in-designer` attribute
   - Finds corresponding items in Navigator panel
   - Adds compact toggle buttons next to element names

3. **Button Behavior**
   - **White background** = attribute value is "false"
   - **Blue background** = attribute value is "true"
   - Click to toggle between true/false
   - Changes reflect immediately on canvas element

### 📋 **Navigator Panel Integration:**

The extension looks for Navigator items using these selectors:
- `[data-automation-id="layers-panel"]`
- `[aria-label*="Navigator"]`
- `[class*="navigator"]`
- `[class*="layers"]`

Then finds individual items by:
- `data-wf-id` attribute matching
- Tree item roles
- Layer/node classes

### ⏱️ **Timeline:**

- **0-2s**: Initial setup
- **2s**: First scan for elements
- **2-10s**: Periodic scans every 2 seconds
- **10s+**: Stops searching, buttons remain functional

### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Reload Webflow Designer page
3. Look for 👁️ buttons next to elements in Navigator panel
4. Check console for:
   - "✅ Found X elements with attribute..."
   - "➕ Adding button for element with wf-id:..."
   - "✅ Button added to Navigator item"

### 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

If buttons don't appear:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify elements have `data-show-in-designer` attribute in Element Settings
3. Ensure Navigator panel is visible (left sidebar)
4. Check that canvas iframe has loaded (id: `site-iframe-next`)

### 📁 **Files Changed:**

- `src/content/content.js` - Completely rewritten (old version backed up as `content.js.backup`)
- `src/utils/webflow-api.js` - Added `closePublishModal()` function
- No manifest changes needed
