# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in three sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## How to create icons:

You can use any image editing tool to create these icons. Here are some options:

1. **Online tools:**
   - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
   - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
   - [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)

2. **Icon generators:**
   - [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
   - [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

3. **Placeholder icons:**
   You can temporarily use simple colored squares with the letter "W" for Webflow

## Design suggestions:
- Use Webflow's brand colors (blue: #146EF5)
- Include a recognizable symbol (e.g., "W", rocket, publish icon)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast

**Note:** Until you add proper icons, the extension will show a default Chrome extension icon.
